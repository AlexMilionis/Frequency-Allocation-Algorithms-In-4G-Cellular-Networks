As part of this thesis, a LTE network simulator was developed in Matlab, with the purpose of studying frequency allocation algorithms in fourth generation (4G) LTE networks. To set up the network, 2x4 SU-MIMO, wireless Rayleigh channel and MMSE receiver were considered. 

Moreover, two different propagation environments were considered, the suburban environment of the municipality of Naxos and the urban environment of the municipality of Athens. Due to the large number of subscribers in the urban environment, it is recommended to sectorize the existing cells. The algorithms used are Round Robin, Best CQI, Proportional Fair and an improved version of Proportional Fair developed for the needs of this thesis. The simulation is executed for 1000 TTI’s (where 1 TTI = 1 ms in LTE), ie for 1 second of real time, as it is considered that the subscribers are stationary throughout the simulation. Before starting the process, the propagation environment is selected and in the end, the simulator displays the results obtained for each of the four algorithms studied. 

The results are the average throughput per subscriber, the cell throughput, and the fairness index, which relates to the way each algorithm distributed network resources to users. The relation between the goal of each algorithm and the above results is studied. Finally, based on the measurements, conclusions are drawn about the future of fourth generation networks and wireless networks in general.
